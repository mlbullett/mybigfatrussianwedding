      There <strong>SHE</strong> sat, in one of the typically rundown and smoky dives just off Torstraße, Berlin's
      wealthy slums. Time crawled on at it's usual imperceptible pace as she phased in and out of her friends'
      conversations. Despite its languor, the evening was coming to a dull close, absent of coveted adventure. Suddenly,
      the door crashed open...

      laying waste to his stomach. They had set out to Chenonceau that morning under the guise of a quixotic expedition,
      little did his better half know what awaited for her. Although he had gotten used to the weight of the small box
      that had been sitting in his pocket for the last four months, it seemed to get exponentially heavier with each
      step down the fir-lined trail until he couldn't bear it anymore and dropped to one knee.

      The wedding day will begin with the traditional Russian Orthodox crowning ceremony in the Church Of the Holy
      Righteous Simeon and Anna the Prophetess. The church was built in 1734 by Empress Anna Ioannovna in the heart of
      Saint Petersburg.<br />
      The ceremony will start with the betrothal service, during which the priest blesses the rings. After which the
      couple exchanges them, placing them on their right hand.<br />
      This is immediately followed by the wedding service. The bride and groom will carry candles as the priest joins
      their hands whilst praying for their marriage. The candle- and hand-holding will continue until the end of the
      ceremony as a symbol of union.<br />
      Now comes the moment for the centerpiece of the Orthodox wedding ceremony: the Crowning. The crowns, held above
      the heads of the bride and the groom by the witnesses, symbolize the glory and honor that is being bestowed on
      them by God during the holy sacrament of marriage.<br />
      After the crowns have been placed firmly on the couple's heads, the bride and groom take three sips of wine from a
      shared cup. The wine is reminiscent of the miracle of the wedding of Cana of Galilee, where water was famously
      turned into wine.<br />
      Finally, the bride and groom will circle the central altar three times, echoing a pre-Christian ritual dance,
      accompanied by a choir. In this act, the couple takes their first steps as a married couple and the ceremony is
      concluded with the ancient blessing "Na zisete" ("May you live!")

      After seeing the lush, rich, Imperial Saint Petersburg, you will get the opportunity to see the other side of the
      city: underground, vintage, and artistic. The reception will take place in the Craft Loft “Vesseniy”, not 15
      minutes away by car. You'll be greeted with bubbles, canapés, and music. Shortly after which, the banquet will be
      served.<br />
      Russian wedding traditions are numerous and rich, a few you may want to know and participate in are as
      follows.<br />
      You may overhear guests talking about the bitterness of the food. This is no culinary critique, but one of the
      traditional wedding games. Guests slowly start to chant "Gorka, gorka, gorka..." (meaning "bitter") until the
      newlyweds kiss after which the guests start counting upwards. The goal being to kiss for as long as possible and
      then exclaim: "No, it's sweet!".<br />
      During the long banquet, all guests are welcome to perform a speech, song, dance, roast, or any other variety of
      number, in groups or alone. With multiple cultures and languages present, this is a relaxed and informal
      pportunity to exchange and bring the party together.

      Russia is a vast and diverse country, full of idyllic and culturally rich cities. As this may be the first time in
      the Russian Federation for a lot of our guests, we have a few tips to make your stay one to remember!
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <h3>{% trans "Visas:" %}</h3>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      The first thing you'll need is a visa. While Russia has a number of <a
        href="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/russian-visa/visa-free-travel/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">visa-free</a> agreements, it is quite likely you'll need to apply for a <a
        href="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/russian-visa/tourist-visas/" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">tourist visa</a>. You'll require a tourist voucher alongside a valid passport, photo, and travel
      insurance. This voucher is either provided by the hotel you'll be staying at or can be <a
        href="https://www.travelrussia.su/en/visa.tourist.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">purchased
        online</a> for a reasonable price if you will be staying at an airbnb for example.<br />
      Once you have all these documents in hand, you'll be required to fill out a <a href="https://visa.kdmid.ru/"
        rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visa application form</a> before submitting the request to the nearest
      Russian Consular Department or Visa Center.<br />
      Keep in mind that application duration can vary from country to country and may require several weeks!
      {% endblocktrans %}

    <h3>{% trans "Accommodation:" %}</h3>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Finding accommodations in Saint Petersburg should be a fairly straightforwards endeavour but, nevertheless, here
      are a few pointers.<br />
      We highly recommend you choose accommodations on the south bank of the Neva river as the bridges are raised at
      night inhibiting traffic. Although Airbnb is a completely viable and cost-effective option, guests desiring to
      stay in hotels should keep in mind that there is no official nationwide hotel rating system in Russia. One should
      thus rely on recognizable international brands or review sites such as <a
        href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Home-g298507" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tripadvisor</a> when
      researching hotels.

      {% trans "Some additional tips to consider during your stay:" %}
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        It is currently illegal to drive with any level of blood-alcohol content in Russia. Thankfully, taxis and
        similar services are cheap and the center of Saint Petersburg is fairly small.
        {% endblocktrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Water sanitation is a somewhat contentious point, with the quality of tap water varying from region to region.
        Although it should be fine in Saint Petersburg, we still recommend only consuming filtered or bottled water when
        possible.
        {% endblocktrans %}

        Tipping is increasingly expected in restaurants in Russia. The standard tip is about 10%.

        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Though Saint Petersburg is the cultural and touristic heart of Russia, you may find it useful to learn some
        basic russian phrases and even how to read Cyrillic (which is really not as daunting as it seems). <a
          href="https://www.duolingo.com/course/ru/en/Learn-Russian" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank">Duolingo</a> has a particularly good basic course as your faithful servant can attest to.
