        The wedding day will begin with the traditional Russian Orthodox crowning ceremony in the Church Of the Holy Righteous Simeon and Anna the Prophetess. The church was built in 1734 by Empress Anna Ioannovna in the heart of Saint Petersburg.<br />
        The ceremony will start with the betrothal service, during which the priest blesses the rings. After which the couple exchanges them, placing them on their right hand.<br />
        This is immediately followed by the wedding service. The bride and groom will carry candles as the priest joins their hands whilst praying for their marriage. The candle- and hand-holding will continue until the end of the ceremony as a symbol of union.<br />
        Now comes the moment for the centerpiece of the Orthodox wedding ceremony: the Crowning. The crowns, held above the heads of the bride and the groom by the witnesses, symbolize the glory and honor that is being bestowed on them by God during the holy sacrament of marriage.<br />
        After the crowns have been placed firmly on the couple's heads, the bride and groom take three sips of wine from a shared cup. The wine is reminiscent of the miracle of the wedding of Cana of Galilee, where water was famously turned into wine.<br />
        Finally, the bride and groom will circle the central altar three times, echoing a pre-Christian ritual dance, accompanied by a choir. In this act, the couple takes their first steps as a married couple and the ceremony is concluded with the ancient blessing "Na zisete" ("May you live!"***REMOVED***

        You may overhear guests talking about the bitterness of the food. This is no culinary critique, but one of the traditional wedding games. Guests slowly start to chant "Gorka, gorka, gorka..." (meaning "bitter"***REMOVED*** until the newlyweds kiss after which the guests start counting upwards. The goal being to kiss for as long as possible and then exclaim: "No, it's sweet!".<br />

          Russia is a vast and diverse country, full of idyllic and culturally rich cities. As this may be the first time in the Russian Federation for a lot of our guests, we have a few tips to make your stay one to remember!

      <h3>{% trans "Visas:" %***REMOVED***</h3>

    ***REMOVED***% blocktrans trimmed %***REMOVED***
          The first thing you'll need is a visa. While Russia has a number of <a href="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/russian-visa/visa-free-travel/">visa-free</a> agreements, it is quite likely you'll need to apply for a <a href="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/russian-visa/tourist-visas/">tourist visa</a>. You'll require a tourist voucher alongside a valid passport, photo, and travel insurance. This voucher is either provided by the hotel you'll be staying at or can be <a href="https://www.travelrussia.su/en/visa.tourist.php"> purchased online</a> for a reasonable price if you will be staying at an airbnb for example.<br />
          Once you have all these documents in hand, you'll be required to fill out a <a href="https://visa.kdmid.ru/">visa application form</a> before submitting the request to the nearest Russian Consular Department or Visa Center.<br />
          Keep in mind that application duration can vary from country to country and may require several weeks!<br />

          Finding accommodations in Saint Petersburg should be a fairly straightforwards endeavour but, nevertheless, here are a few pointers.<br />
          We highly recommend you choose accommodations on the south bank of the Neva river as the bridges are raised at night inhibiting traffic. Although Airbnb is a completely viable and cost-effective option, guests desiring to stay in hotels should keep in mind that there is no official nationwide hotel rating system in Russia. One should thus rely on recognizable international brands or review sites such as <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Home-g298507">Tripadvisor</a> when researching hotels.

                It is currently illegal to drive with any level of blood-alcohol content in Russia. Thankfully, taxis and similar services are cheap and the center of Saint Petersburg is fairly small.

                Water sanitation is a somewhat contentious point, with the quality of tap water varying from region to region. Although it should be fine in Saint Petersburg, we still recommend only consuming filtered or bottled water when possible.
