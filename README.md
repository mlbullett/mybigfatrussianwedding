# My Big Fat Russian Wedding Website and Backend

The website and guest management system I hastily assembled for my own wedding in 2019.
<br />
It's a stylish, responsive (looks fab on mobile), fully-animated, multi-language website with contact and rsvp forms, and some degree of automation. It also has the usual handy Django admin backend configured.
<br />
Hopefully this can save some other couples some time.
<br />
Unfortunately this will probably no longer be online at the time you read this but have some pictures:
